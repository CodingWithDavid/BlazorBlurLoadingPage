## Why

I know you can use CSS to replace the stand "Loading..." when you application starts, but I was looking for something more.  After building this I relaized it adds a bit of anticapation to the application starting as well.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository

   ```Command Line
   git clone https://github.com/CodingWithDavid/BlazorBlurLoadingPage
   cd BlazorBlurLoadingPage
   ```

1.	Open in Visual Studio or Visual Code
a.	With Visual Code you will need to install the C# extensions
2.	Press F5

## What's in the App

I am using the basic Server side Blazor template but the code is the same wither it is Server side or client side.

1. Adding and removing style dynamicly
2. Using a timer
3. Using the Navigation Manager
4. CSS scaling transaction dynamicly
